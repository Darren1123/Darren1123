## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Darren Bridges, and I am a cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in IT support, threat detection, and incident response. My passion lies in protecting digital environments by identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing security threats, and implementing best practices to safeguard critical systems.

With experience in network security, SIEM tools like Splunk, and hands-on knowledge of risk assessment frameworks such as NIST and SOC 2, I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can contribute to proactive security measures. My background in customer service has also strengthened my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively, making security solutions more accessible to teams and organizations.

I am continuously expanding my expertise in ethical hacking, log analysis, and cloud security, with a goal of becoming a leading SOC Analyst. Iâ€™m excited about opportunities to apply my skills to protect organizations from evolving cyber threats.
